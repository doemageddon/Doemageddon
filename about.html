    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Doemageddon is a nonprofit organization formed by a couple of regular guys that have a passion for whitetail hunting in Michigan.  We saw an opportunity to help solve two problems in michigan: 1. The amount of people that go without dinner every night, and 2. The over population of does in Michigan.  We figured, "Hey, why not kill two birds with one stone?"; and thus, Doemageddon was born.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      At Doemageddon, we strive to put on an annual event that brings hunters from all over the state together for a common goal; help those that are less fortunate.  Our innaugural event this year will host 100 hunters to harvest 100 does, that will be processed by Apex Custom Butchering, in Owosso, MI.  All of the meat from this event will be donated to the local food banks, shelters, etc.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Doemageddon, our mission is to harness the tradition of ethical deer hunting to combat hunger in our communities. By responsibly harvesting surplus deer populations, our  hunters provide high-quality, nutritious venison to food banks, shelters, and families in need. We are committed to conservation, community, and compassion-bridging the gap between sustainable wildlife management and hunger relief.

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <p>
      At Doemageddon, we are hoping to start a tradition that makes a lasting impact on our local communities by donating hundreds of pounds of healthy venison in 2025.
