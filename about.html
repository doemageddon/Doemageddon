    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Doemageddon is a nonprofit organization formed by hunters with a heart for helping. We believe in the power of the outdoors to not only provide sustenance, but also build stronger, more compassionate communities.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Our annual hunt gathers ethical, licensed hunters across Michigan to responsibly harvest deer. The processed venison is donated directly to food banks, shelters, and families in need — ensuring nothing goes to waste and everything goes to good use.

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Since our founding, we've provided thousands of pounds of venison to families across the state — feeding the hungry, reducing deer overpopulation, and strengthening community ties in the process.
